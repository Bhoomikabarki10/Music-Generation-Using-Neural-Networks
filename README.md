# Music-Generation-Using-Neural-Networks
This project demonstrates how deep learning can be used to generate music automatically. Using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, the system learns musical patterns from existing MIDI files and generates new, original music compositions in MIDI format.
